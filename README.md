Kia ora e hoa! My name is Carolina (she/her), and I am a Law and Arts student from Aotearoa who also codes and their spare time (which is very little these days, lol). 

I have been coding for a decent chunk of time since 2018, completely self-teaching myself how to over the years which has allowed me to develop knowledge in a variety of languages.

Oh, also, I love photography. Here is a random photo I took not too long ago as of writing this, because why not!
